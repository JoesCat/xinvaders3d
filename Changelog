xinv3d (1.4.0)
  * This started as a resurection of a Debian orphaned program
    'xinv3d' brought up to date and made buildable with current
    PCs. See URL: https://github.com/JoesCat/xinv3d
    Thanks to Debian's Ricardo Mones for suggesting rethreading
    from an earlier release. This version starts from earliest
    release found == version 1.31 based on an ibiblio tarball.
    NOTE: No CVS file system found therefore started fresh 1.31.
  * Imported code HP-UX (1.31) fixes, 2000feb07, unknown author.
  * Imported fixes and improvements, the moving of game text to
    gtext.h, and a detailed history added to README all done by
    Chris Butler for Debian's xinv3d ver{1.3.6-1...1.3.6-6}.
    NOTE: This import is smaller than a complete 1.3.6-6 clone.
  * Import xinv3d.6 manual written by Chris Butler for Debian's
    xinv3d 1.3.6-1 (but may be used by others).
  * Speed-up vector font drawing by changing multiplications to
    a few value increments. This benefits lower-powered CPUs.
  * Bug-fix for lower-right quadrant void of stars.
  * Timer-math bugfix that makes game seem to run very slowly on
    very fast computer even though game is running at thousands
    of frames per second.
  * Updated xinv3d to be built using autoreconf -i and automake.
    Added freedesktop and new icons (resolves Debian #738066).
  * Replaced old make. Bumped version number from 1.3x to 1.4.0

xinv3d (1.3.1)
  * Fixed drawing order. Objects were being drawn in reverse.
 -- Don Llopis <del23@users.sourceforge.net> 2000 Feb 07

xinv3d (1.3)
  * Many thanks to Thomas Boutell, he has contributed a
    Windows port of XInvaders 3D. See README.win for more
    information.
  * XInvaders 3D DOS port finished. XInvaders 3D will now run
    as a full-screen 640x480x8 DOS game. For windows users it
    will run in a DOS window just fine. I used DJGPP+Allegro
    to port it. See README.dos for more information.
  * Added Vector-fonts. All text graphics have been replaced
    with Vector-fonts. Gives the game a cleaner look.
  * New player blinking routine. Player now cycles through
    red colors, rather than being drawn each alternate frame,
    when a new level has been started.
  * New special effect: 1-UP indicator. When 7500pts have
    been reached a new life is indicated by a nice little
    vector 1-UP floating towards the player.
  * New alien-shoot missile routine. Aliens now shoot more.
  * New Distance-of-Point-to-Line routine, used for
    collision detection.
  * Added fix for FreeBSD systems, thanks to Peter da Silva.
  * Fixed ZONE_HEIGHT bug in game.c, which was generating bad
    pointers, thanks to Sam Bushell.
  * Cleaned up code, for portability reasons, thanks to
    Thomas Boutell for his help.
  * Left-Shift key is no longer being used.
 -- Don Llopis <dllopi01@fiu.edu>  2000 Feb 05
